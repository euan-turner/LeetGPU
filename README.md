## Available Simulation Modes
- **Functional Mode**  
  Performs a basic simulation of your CUDA program, focusing on correctness and output verification.  
  Fastest simulation option, ideal for testing program logic and debugging.

- **Cycle Accurate Mode**  
  Provides detailed architectural simulation by modeling the GPU hardware cycle-by-cycle.  
  Slower, but offers performance insights and helps predict actual GPU performance.

## Supported CUDA Features
- Constant memory  
- Global memory  
- Shared memory  
- CUDA Streams  
- CUDA Events  
- Atomic operations  

---

## Current Limitations
- Texture memory  
- Dynamic parallelism  
- CUDA Graphs  
- Warp-level primitives (shuffle, vote, etc.)
